### Welcome to the Javascript dojo

Welcome everybody to the very first Javascript coding dojo. The aim of it is to go through the Javascript principles, learning from the bottom, while we create our own dojo.

### What will we be learning?

- Prototypes - objects, classes and more!
- 'this' usage - bind, call, apply... THIS is the time to learn.
- Functional programming - map, filter, reduce, side effects?
- ES6/ES7 - Let's destructure the dojo!
- CSS good practices.

### What will we not be learning?

- React. 
- Angular. 
- Vue. 
- Anything framework-related.

May the force be with you!
